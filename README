SPARQL HTTP client library
==========================

Performs SELECT and ASK queries on an endpoint which implements the HTTP (GET or POST) 
bindings of the SPARQL Protocol.

This library was designed to have no other dependencies than the Python standard library.

API based on SPARQL JavaScript Library by Lee Feigenbaum and Elias Torres
http://www.thefigtrees.net/lee/sw/sparql.js

Heavy influence from Juan Manuel Caicedo's SPARQL library

API:
----

First you open a connection to the endpoint::

    s = sparql.Service(endpoint)

Then you make the query::

    result = s.query(statement)

If you have made a SELECT query, then you can read the result with fetchone() or fetchall()::

    for row in result.fetchone():

If you have made an ASK query, then you can read the result (a boolean value) with hasresult():

    works = result.hasresult()


Conversion of data types:
-------------------------

The library will automatically convert typed literals to a coresponding
simple type in Python. Dates are also converted if the dateutil_ library is
available.

Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

If you have nose_ installed, just run ``nosetests`` in the top-level directory.
Some tests require the python-dateutil_ (version 1.5) or mock_ libraries.
Tested under Python 2.4 through 2.7.
